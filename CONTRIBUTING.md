## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all new code
- **ESLint**: Follow the existing ESLint configuration
- **Prettier**: Code formatting is handled automatically
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and components
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex logic and business rules

### Component Guidelines

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Descriptive component with proper typing
interface DeviceCardProps {
  device: Device;
  onStatusChange: (deviceId: string, status: DeviceStatus) => void;
}

const DeviceCard: React.FC<DeviceCardProps> = ({ device, onStatusChange }) => {
  // Component implementation
};

// ‚ùå Avoid: Generic names and missing types
const Card = ({ data, callback }) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### Database Changes

- **Migrations**: All database changes must include proper migrations
- **RLS Policies**: Ensure Row Level Security policies are updated
- **Documentation**: Document schema changes in migration comments

### Security Requirements

- **Authentication**: All API endpoints must be properly authenticated
- **Authorization**: Implement proper role-based access control
- **Data Validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **Sanitization**: Sanitize data before database operations

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Write component tests for React components
- Include edge cases and error scenarios

```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('DeviceService', () => {
  describe('registerDevice', () => {
    it('should register a new device successfully', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    it('should handle duplicate device registration', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```
